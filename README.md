# deepART

deepART is a Python module which aims to support the application of neural networks based on Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) in solving machine learning problems. As ART neural networks supports returning the reasons for which predictions are made
by the networks, they are highly suitable to be applied to environments where trustworthy and auditable machine learning models are essential.
